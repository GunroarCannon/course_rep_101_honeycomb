# 🎓 Course Rep 101

**Course Rep 101** is a fun, light-hearted decision-making game where you play as a **university course representative** trying to survive the chaos of campus life. Think quick decisions, unpredictable consequences, and a balancing act between four fragile stats:

- 💰 **Money** – Budgets, grants, student fees... manage it or watch it disappear.
- 🌟 **Popularity** – Keep the student body happy, or face their wrath.
- 🙏 **Piousness** – Navigate moral, ethical, and occasionally cult-like responsibilities.
- 🧠 **Sanity** – Keep it together. Or don’t. You’re just a student after all.
